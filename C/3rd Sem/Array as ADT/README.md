# Array as an ADT

## Description
ADT stands for Abstract Data Type.
Arrays are ADT’s because they are capable of holding contiguous elements in the same order. And they allow access for the specific element via index.



Let’s say we name out abstract data type as “myArray” to store integer data types.
Which will have properties like:-
-int totalSize;
-int alloSize;
-int *ptr;

We will have some functions which we could perform with our ADT myArray like:-
-create(A) : To create an array A and accept values from user
-insert(A,X) : To insert an element X in any location of array A
-delete(A,X) : To delete an element X from array A
-modify(A,X,Y) : To modify element X by Y in array A
-travel(A) : To display all the elements of array A
-merge(A,B,C)  : To merge array A and array B into array C
