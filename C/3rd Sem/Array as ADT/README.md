# Array as an ADT

## Description
ADT stands for Abstract Data Type.
Arrays are ADT’s because they are capable of holding contiguous elements in the same order. And they allow access for the specific element via index.


Declaration of struct Array :-
Let’s say we name out abstract data type as “myArray” to store integer data types.
Which will have properties like:-
>   int totalSize;
   int alloSize;
   int *ptr;
